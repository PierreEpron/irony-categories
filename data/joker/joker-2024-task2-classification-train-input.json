This is the reason they have been used on the front line of the British army for the last 300 years.\n\nThe French government announced yesterday that it has raised its alert level from \"Run\" to \"Hide.\" The only two higher levels in France are \"Collaborate\" and \"Surrender.\" The rise was precipitated by a recent fire that destroyed France's white flag factory, effectively paralyzing the country's military capability.\n\nItaly has increased the alert level from \"Shout Loudly and Excitedly\" to \"Elaborate Military Posturing.\" Two more levels remain: \"Ineffective Combat Operations\" and \"Change Sides.\"\n\nThe Germans have increased their alert state from \"Disdainful Arrogance\" to \"Dress in Uniform and Sing Marching Songs.\" They also have two higher levels: \"Invade a Neighbour\" and \"Lose.\"\n\nBelgians, on the other hand, are all on holiday as usual; the only threat they are worried about is NATO pulling out of Brussels.\n\nThe Spanish are all excited to see their new submarines ready to deploy. These beautifully designed subs have glass bottoms so the new Spanish navy can get a really good look at the old Spanish navy.\n\nAustralia, meanwhile, has raised its alert level from \"No worries\" to \"She'll be alright, Mate.\" Two more escalation levels remain: \"Crikey! I think we'll need to cancel the barbie this weekend!\" and \"The barbie is cancelled.\" So far, no situation has ever warranted use of the final escalation level."},{"id":578,"text":"Coronavirus: Cambodia refuses to evacuate citizens from China as 'we need to share their happiness and pain'"},{"id":660,"text":"Remember those stupid questions we used to ask each other before the pandemic... like \"what's your 5 year plan?\""},{"id":175,"text":"Watch me make bad decisions even without the influence of alcohol."},{"id":607,"text":"OHSAA coronavirus rules: Students can wrestle, but can't shake hands"},{"id":1874,"text":"A scientist doing a large experiment with liquid chemicals was trying to solve a problem when he fell in and became part of the solution."},{"id":1831,"text":"When gossip finally led to the landlady's arrest for murdering her tenants and scattering parts of their bodies around town, her only comment was,'' Well, that's what comes of spreading rumors.''"},{"id":2451,"text":"Our theft of raw gold from the mine site was a fiasco because, as we jumped into the getaway boat, we dropped the ore."},{"id":1554,"text":"What's the name of my cheese?
